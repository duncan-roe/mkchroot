.TH MKCHROOT 1 "May 30 2017" "Misc commands" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
mkchroot, addchroot \- Create chroot-able tree using hard links where
possible
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3mkchroot\f1 \f2directory\f1
.br
\f3addchroot\f1 \f2directory\f1 \f2package\f1 [...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f3mkchroot\f1 creates a file structure under (possibly new) \f2directory\f1
such that
\f3chroot\f1 \f2directory\f1 \f3/bin/sh\f1
will give a shell prompt with \f2directory\f1 as /.
The shell will have access to the following packages
(but see \f3ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\f1 below)
.RS 3
aaa_elflibs
.br
glibc-solibs
.br
bash
.br
coreutils
.br
grep

and a usable \f3/dev\f1 which is the intersection of the entries in
\f2package\f1
devs and those in the system
\f3/dev\f1 directory.
.PP
To use the least disk space, \f2directory\f1
should be in the same file system as that in which the packages were installed.
If this is not possible (e.g. due to installing to multiple partitions),
it is usually optimal to have \f2directory\f1
in the same file system as \f3/usr\f1.
See \f2MKCHROOT_IGNORE_LN_ERRORS\f1 below.
.PP
\f3addchroot\f1 installs \f2package\f1 to \f2directory\f1
by hard linking or copying the files in the package.
.br
\f3addchroot\f1 also runs the install script for \f2package\f1,
if it exists in \f4/var/log/scripts\f1.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
Environment variables manage the detailed operation of the \f3addchroot\f1
command family.
.PP
\f2MKCHROOT_FOR_GCC\f1
.RS 3
If set, \f3mkchroot\f1 will install glibc instead of glibc-solibs.
.RE
.PP
\f2MKCHROOT_IGNORE_LN_ERRORS\f1
.RS 3
If set, \f3mkchroot\f1 and \f3addchroot\f1 will suppress errors from \f3ln\f1
failing to create hard links.
.br
If the errors are "Invalid cross-device link",
it is safe to ignore them.
However the resultant file system tree will use a lot more space than with hard
linking.
.br
There will be a large number of these errors if \f2directory\f1
is not in the same file system as that in which the packages are installed.
.RE
.PP
\f2VERBOSE_ADDCHROOT\f1
.RS 3
If set, \f3mkchroot\f1 (and hence \f3addchroot\f1)
will report each \f2package\f1 as it commences installation.
